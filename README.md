https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29b27af3-ace4-422a-84ee-2960354a515b

This project is a **deep learning-based image classification model** that distinguishes between **cats** and **dogs** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained on a **Kaggle dataset**, accessed via the **Kaggle API**, and implemented in **Google Colab** for efficient training and execution.  

### 🔹 Key Features  
✔️ **Binary image classification** (Cats 🐱 vs. Dogs 🐶)  
✔️ **Trained on a Kaggle dataset** using the Kaggle API  
✔️ **Implemented in Google Colab** for seamless execution  
✔️ **Deep learning-based CNN model** built with TensorFlow and Keras  
✔️ **Pre-trained model** available for quick deployment 

### 🔹 Dataset  
The dataset is retrieved from **Kaggle** using the **Kaggle API**, containing labeled images of cats and dogs.  

### 🔹 Technologies Used  
- **Google Colab** (Cloud-based training)  
- **Kaggle API** (Dataset retrieval)  
- **TensorFlow | Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)  
- **OpenCV | Matplotlib** (Image Processing & Visualization)  
- **NumPy | Pandas** (Data Handling)
